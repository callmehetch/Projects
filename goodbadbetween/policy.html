<h3><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></h3> 
<p>We collect and use your information below to provide our Services and to measure and improve them over time.</p> 
<p><strong>Information Collected Upon Registration:</strong> We use Facebook Login so you can use your existing Facebook.com account to access the features of the Site. You must explicitly authorize Facebook to share your information with us when you first login to the Site with your Facebook credentials. When you create or reconfigure a account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, is listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do not require registration.</p> 
<p><strong>Additional Information:</strong> You may provide us with profile information to make public, such as a short biography, your location, your website, or a picture. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may unsubscribe from notifications from GOOD BAD BETWEEN. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your GOOD BAD BETWEEN account to your account on another service in order to cross-post between GOOD BAD BETWEEN and that service, the other service may send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. This information enables cross-posting, helps us improve the Services, and is deleted from GOOD BAD BETWEEN within a few weeks of your disconnecting from GOOD BAD BETWEEN and your account on the other service.</p> 
<p><strong>Viewpoints, Following, User Profiles and other Public Information:</strong> Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the information you post and the metadata provided with viewpoints, such as when you posted, but also the lists you create, the people you follow, the viewpoints you mark as saved to library or, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Services. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide public for as long as you do not delete it from GOOD BAD BETWEEN, but we generally give you settings to make the information more private if you want. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your public user profile information and public viewpoints may be searchable by search engines and are immediately delivered via our APIs to a wide range of users and services. When you share information or content like photos, text, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.</p> 
<p><strong>Links:</strong> GOOD BAD BETWEEN may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p> 
<p><strong>Cookies:</strong> Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. GOOD BAD BETWEEN may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.</p>

Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your GOOD BAD BETWEEN account to authenticate to a third-party website or application, or visit a third-party website that includes a GOOD BAD BETWEEN button. GOOD BAD BETWEEN uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them. If not already done earlier, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.</p>

These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address.
